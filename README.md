Key Features:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loads the dataset, selects relevant features (texture_mean and radius_mean), and preprocesses the data for analysis.

KNN Classification: Implements KNN with k=5 to predict the diagnosis (malignant or benign).

Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance using a confusion matrix.

Data Visualization:

Creates scatter plots of texture_mean vs. radius_mean for benign and malignant tumors.

Plots the decision boundary for KNN with k=5 and k=15 to visualize the classification regions.
